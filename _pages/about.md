Hi there! I’m Yan, a first-year PhD student in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences (EECS) at UC Berkeley, working with [Professor Christopher Fletcher](https://cwfletcher.github.io/). Before coming to Berkeley, I spent eight years in Toronto, where I completed high school and earned a B.A.S. in Engineering Science with a major in Machine Intelligence.

During my undergrad, I had the chance to work on some exciting projects with professors from the University of Toronto and ETH Zurich, which sparked my passion for computer architecture.

When I’m not immersed in research, I enjoy hiking, reading, and playing board games.

Please feel free to reach out to me by email at zhuyan14 [at] berkeley [dot] edu.
